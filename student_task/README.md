# Student Task:

**Objective:** 

By completing this task, students will gain a deep understanding of how to manage the state in a Flutter application using two popular state management solutions, Provider and Riverpod**.**

**Prerequisites**:

• Basic knowledge of Flutter and Dart programming.

• Have Flutter and Dart installed on your development environment.

**Task Description**:

Your goal is to create a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of both "Provider" and "Riverpod" for state management. You'll build a counter application where the user can increment and decrement a counter value, and you'll use both state management solutions to handle the application's state.

**Steps**:

**Step 1: Set Up Your Flutter Project:**

• Create a new Flutter project named "StateManagementDemo" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.

**Step 2: Implement the Provider Approach:**

1. In the main.dart file, create a Flutter application that displays a counter value.

2. Implement state management using the Provider package. The counter value should be stored in a provider and updated when the user interacts with the UI.

**Step 3: Implement the Riverpod Approach:**

1. Create a new file named "riverpod_demo.dart."

2. Implement state management using Riverpod to achieve the same functionality as in the Provider approach.

**Step 4: Display the Counter Value:**

• In your main.dart file, display the counter value and buttons to increment and decrement it.

**Step 5: Create a Boilerplate Code:**

• Provide the students with a boilerplate code for both the Provider and Riverpod approaches, explaining the key parts of the code, such as how to define providers, update the state, and connect it to the UI.

**Step 6: Additional Challenges (Optional):**

To challenge yourself and gain a deeper understanding, you can add some optional tasks:

- Implement error handling in both state management solutions.
- Implement a reset button to reset the counter.
- Add unit tests to ensure the correctness of your code.

**Submission**:

1. Create a public GitHub repository named "CODED-CC-task."
2. Organize your code, including both Provider and Riverpod implementations, in separate branches labeled "provider" and "riverpod."
3. Include a README file with clear instructions on how to run the project.
4. Document your code and explain how Provider and Riverpod are used for state management in your project.

**Note**: Remember to make your code and documentation clear and well-organized. This task should help students understand the practical use of Provider and Riverpod in state management and should serve as a valuable learning resource.

Once the students complete this task, they will have hands-on experience with both Provider and Riverpod for Flutter state management. This should empower them with the knowledge and skills needed to make informed decisions about which state management solution to use in their own Flutter projects
